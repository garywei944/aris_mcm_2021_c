# MCM 2021 Problem C

## Overview
This repository is cloned from the private one my team used for MCM/ICM 2021. I removed data from MCM and the figures that we used in our paper. But the data could be downloaded by the following instructions and the codes that plots the figure is preserved.  
  
The Initial Commit is the version of codes that I implemented during the competition.

## Import Data
Please unzip and put `2021_MCM_Problem_C_Data` and `2021_MCM_Problem_C_Data` folder under the root directory. No need to change the name of the 2 folders. The data could be download at the [MCM Website](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2021/problems/)

## Contribution
The math models and codes in this repository is proposed and implemented by me. Due to policy concerns, I didn't upload our submitted paper here, but the paper is also contributed by [Gavin Duan](https://github.com/GavinDuan513) and [Yichong Liu](https://github.com/YiChong-Liu).
